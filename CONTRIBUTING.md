#### Contributing

- To get started, run `npm init-dev`. This will create a pre-commit hook that warns you if you try to commit changes to `config.js`. It would be easy to forget to remove your own custom settings before committing otherwise.
- Do not commit to `master` - please use a branch with the [slash naming convention](http://guyroutledge.co.uk/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/)
- Be sure to configure your fork with this repo as the [upstream remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [keep it up to date](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
- Thanks!
